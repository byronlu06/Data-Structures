## Written Response

### 3a
- Our create task project was a rock paper scissors game created with javascript functions and procedures. The overall purpose of the program is to create a game on our website that relates to our project. Our project is a canvas page that allows students to access their calendar, classboard, grades, and schedule, and includes a quiz page, flashcards, and small minigames.
- As seen in the video, when you choose your option and click it, it displays the computer's option and tells you whether you won, tied, or lost.
- The input to the program is the option that you choose, either rock, paper, or scissors and the output is whether you win, lose, or tie. The javascript function checks the player’s input and compares it to the computer’s, and shows the result of the two options.

- The name of the list being used in the program is cOptions.
- The data contained in the list represents the inputs for the player.
- The list manages complexity in the program because it stores the values of the player inputs inside the cOptions variable. If we did not use the list, we would have to check the input for each individual option inside the variable.

- The procedure checks if either the player or computer has reached 5 points and won the game. This contributes to the overall functionality of the program because without it, there would be no way to identify a winner and the game would continue on forever.
- The algorithm implemented in the identified procedure checks for the value of pScore and cScore and uses and if statement to test if it is equal to 5. If either statements are true, the program will alert the player and send the message for the winner.

- The condition being tested is whether the player or computer has reached 5 points and won the game.
- The result of the call is the program alerting the player the winner of the game by sending a message.
