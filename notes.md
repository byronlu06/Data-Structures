## 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects

Learning Objectives
* Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful

Essential Knowledge
* People create computing innovations
* The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
* Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
* A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person

Accelerometers
* Automobile industry drove prices down
* Used for airbag deployment and lateral movement detection
* Quadcopter “brain”
* The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations

Beneficial and Harmful Effects
* Deliveries, finding lost people, aerial photography is easy
* Flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous, privacy concerns
* Gets people active playing videogames
* Broken TV’s and injuries

## 5.2 Digital Divide
Learning Objectives
* Describe issues that contribute to the digital divide

Essential Knowledge
* Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
* The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
* The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
* The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments

## 5.3 Computing Bias

Learning Objectives
* Explain how bias exists in computing innovations

Essential Knowledge
* Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
* Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development

Hypothetical Loan Company
* Creating software to assist loan officers
* Find trends in successful loans
* Reject those who don’t fit their trends:
     * Age
     * Gender
     * Race/Ethnicity
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases

## 5.4 Crowdsourcing

Learning Objectives
* Explain how people participate in problem-solving processes at a scale

Essential Knowledge
* Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet
* Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
* Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding

Public Data Sets
* Kaggle
     * Courses in visualizations, TensorFlows, AI, machine learning, and more
     * Competitions - cash prizes, swag, props
     * Notebooks - code, data, notes
* Google Public Datasets
     * Free for the 1st terabyte
