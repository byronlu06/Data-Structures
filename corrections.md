Q3: The option I chose is incorrect because open-source software can be freely modified, and doing so does not in itself raise any legal or ethical concerns.

Q4: The option I chose is incorrect because some individuals are unable to use computing devices effectively due to lack of education and experience with these devices.

Q5: The option I chose is incorrect because a simulation is run on a computer and is not likely to require input from individuals distributed around the world.

Q10: The option I chose is incorrect because option III works correctly, but option I does not. Option I does not work because it performs the shorten step before the keep palindromes step.

Q19: The option I chose is incorrect because a value is displayed only when y = true, which occurs when x is negative.

Q25: The option I chose is incorrect because the application only sends notifications to compatible users who are nearby. Since not all people will be considered compatible, users are unlikely to be able to identify all other users in the area.

Q26: The option I chose is incorrect because having a variety of backgrounds represented on a team can enable the team to make use of the different strengths of individual team members.

Q27: The option I chose is incorrect because unsolvable problems cannot be solved with an algorithm.

Q36: The option I chose is incorrect because the count is not an approximation of an analog measurement.

Q40: The option I chose is incorrect because the work may be distributed to amateur or nonprofessional individuals, who are not likely to have the same accuracy as the professional researchers.

Q41: The option I chose is incorrect because this information can be determined using the data collected, but not in the way described in this option. The average amount spent per day during the 7-day period is the sum of all the total transaction amounts divided by 7.

Q17: The option I chose is incorrect because Version I calls GetPrediction once for each element of idList, while version II calls GetPrediction twice for each element of idList (plus one more time at the end). Therefore, version II takes more than 1 minute longer than version I.

Q18: The option I chose is incorrect because public key encryption uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Symmetric encryption is a method that uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.

Q21: The option I chose is incorrect because for every bit, 2 times as many numbers can be represented so 64 bits compared to 32 bits will allow 2^32 more values to be represented by the bits.
