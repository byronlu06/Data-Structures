## 5.3 Computing Bias

Learning Objectives
* Explain how bias exists in computing innovations

Essential Knowledge
* Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
* Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development

Hypothetical Loan Company
